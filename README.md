## ‚ú® Simple authentication login register with authority in code igniter 3  ‚ú®

</p>

‚ú® üëã Hi Everyone üëã ‚ú®

Now I want to share an example of the Igniter 3 code project with you, where this project has features for logging in and registering. This project is suitable for those of you who want to learn to create logins and registers with several different authorities such as admin and user. in this project I created 3 different authorities namely ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_USER and ROLE_CLIENT. For ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_USER I have a different display when successfully logging in, I don't use ROLE_CLIENT itself but I have provided a place to add it so you can change it according to your wishes.

## Step after your clone this project :

- Create a new database with the name "placement" then import the placement.sql file in folder "Database".
- Then rename the project folder to "placement"
- Move folder "placement" to your localhost
- Open your project file and open file database.php located in the <b> application->config folder.</b>
- Edit the 'hostname, username, password, database' section to match the data from your MySQL.
- Final step you can access your project via your browser.

## Authentication Login :

> To log in as admin, I have provided an email and password in one of the data in the database.

    Username => admin
    Password => password

> Meanwhile, to log in as a user, you must register first using the available features or you can also use the account that I have provided in the database.

    Username => user
    Password => user1
